allow user to upload two or more tcx files which are appended together

in the left column, initially show two data upload buttons as presently, stacked vertically. 
If the first two are already full, show a plus symbol below these. If the user hits the plus symbol, another upload button appears. If the user uploads a file into that one, the plus button appears below it again. This can be repeated an arbitrary number of times. 

For each file the user uploads, show the clear button as currently. 

For files 3-n, show a minus button next to the upload button. If the user hits this, the upload button, and corresponding file (if any are loaded) are cleared. 

For each file that's uploaded, plot it as currently. DIfferent colour for each file







            // const addUploadButton = document.createElement('button');
            // addUploadButton.textContent = '+';
            // addUploadButton.className = 'button button-small';
            // addUploadButton.addEventListener('click', createUploadField);
            // <button id="add-upload-button" class="button">+</button>

            uploadWrapper.appendChild(fileInput);
            uploadWrapper.appendChild(clearButton);

            if (id > 1) uploadWrapper.appendChild(removeButton);

            // if (id >= 6) {
            //     if (addUploadButton) addUploadButton.remove();

            // }
